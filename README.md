# AI Internship Projects – Coincent.ai (Languify AI Program)

This repository contains projects completed during my Artificial Intelligence internship at **Coincent.ai**, focused on deep learning and computer vision.

## 🧠 Project 1: Vision Transformer (ViT) for Handwritten Digit Classification
- Implemented a Vision Transformer (ViT) model in **Python** for handwritten digit classification on the **MNIST dataset**.
- Included patch embeddings, positional encodings, and transformer encoder blocks.
- Achieved ~98% accuracy.

## 🎯 Project 2: Object Detection using TensorFlow
- Built a **multi-output CNN** for both digit classification and bounding box localization on a modified MNIST dataset.
- Implemented in **TensorFlow and Keras**.
- Combined classification and regression heads for object detection.
